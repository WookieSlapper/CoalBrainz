        <h3>WELCOME</h3>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to the web site of <span style="font-size: 32px; color:#ff6600">WookieSlapper</span>, a shiny-new programmer charting his way through a mid-life career change.</p>
        <h3>IN THE BEGINNING</h3>
        <p>So how does one become WookieSlapper? And what makes someone decide to be a forty-something entry-level programmer? 
        Well, my friends, just sit right back, and you'll hear a tale...</p><br />
         <p>It all started when education became a business. I was a tenured high school English teacher in a small rural school in New York State. In the same year the bean-counters there gave our district Superintendent 
            (who had yet to be hired) a $20,000 raise, the decision was made to eliminate over a dozen teaching positions due to a lack of budgetary resources (pay attention to the irony here!). 
             This meant that all the work I had done to become a teacher, including acquiring a Master's degree in English and Education, 
             and all of the 10 years I had spent as a teacher, instantly became worthless. I then set myself adrift in a sea of doubt and regret. I was 41, with a mortgage and two children, and 
             no job or career prospects. I'm also pretty sure I was being stalked by a white whale . . . .
         </p>
        <h3>AND THEN THERE WAS LIGHT, AND IT WAS GOOD</h3>
        <p>So, I have this friend, <a href="http://www.spykebytes.me/#/About" target="_blank">Spike</a>. One day, my friend says to me, "Why don't you try computer programming?" And then I says back to him, I says, "What is an old guy like me going to 
            do, go back to school and start all over again? I'm too old for that."</p>
        <p>He then went on to tell me about all 
            the glories of learning to code, how anyone could learn it. He told me about how there was a dearth of programmers, and that there were always going to be jobs. This was, after all, the dawn of a new digital age.
            He went on to tell me about people who were in the same position I was who found new life and new hope in front of a keyboard,
             and how he knew of a middle-aged woman who left her career to start a life as a programmer. I then got invited to this party he threw that was filled with 
            computer geeks (I'm pretty sure it was a set-up). Within a couple of weeks, I was already working on <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a>, learning how to write code in HTML,
            CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. I was hooked.
        </p>
        <h3>IN THE LION'S DEN</h3>
        <p>And so, now we come to it. I created this web site as a first official "project" to test out all of the things I've been learning, and continue to learn. This web site is a work in progress, so
            please forgive me if there are mistakes along the way. What you see before you is a result of time spent learning Visual Studio, SourceTree, GitHub, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, and a bunch of 
            other libraries, frameworks, and extensions, not to mention the logic and syntax that goes along with it. It's a liquid thing, and it will flow and change with time, hopefully into something 
            awesome and worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>If you're interested in keeping up with how things go, please check out the Blog and Resume pages occassionally, which will be updated with progress, problems, pains and parables (and not without
            a little alliteration and humor). I look forward to sharing the journey with you, and hearing back from you on how you think I'm doing. See you on the other side!
